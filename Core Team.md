# SwifterSwift Core Team

The SwifterSwift Core Team is a group of SwifterSwift contributors that have demonstrated a lasting enthusiasm for the project and community. The Core Team has GitHub admin privileges on all SwifterSwift repos.

## SwifterSwift Team Responsibilities

The SwifterSwift Core Team has the following responsibilities:

- Being available to answer high-level questions about SwifterSwift's vision and future.
- Being available to review longstanding/forgotten pull requests.
- Occasionally check SwifterSwift issues, offer input, and categorize with GitHub issue labels.
- Looking out for up-and-coming members of the SwifterSwift community who might want to serve as Core Team members.

Note that the SwifterSwift Core Team – and all SwifterSwift contributors – are open source _volunteers_; membership on the Core Team is expressly _not_ an obligation. The Core Team is distinguished as leaders in the community and while they are a good group to turn to when someone needs an answer to a question, they are still volunteering their time, and may not be available to help immediately.

## Adding new Core Team Members

The process for adding new Core Team members is as follows:

- An existing Core Team member reaches out privately to see if the individual is interested. If they are, open a pull request adding them to the list. 
- Existing Core Team members review the pull request. The person merging the PR is responsible for adding them to the Core Team GitHub group.
